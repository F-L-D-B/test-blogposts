FLDB Here.

I'm beginning to get tired of playing Runescape. I am currently in a burn out phase. For those who are not aware, burn out is when you do something so often or for such a long period of time at once where you no longer receive any dopamine from doing the activity.

This is a very common occurence when it comes to Runescape in particular since it is a **very** grindy game.

Anyways, maybe I'll get the fire back soon to play.

FLDB out.

PEACE.
